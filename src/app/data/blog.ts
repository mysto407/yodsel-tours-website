## When is the Best Time to Visit Bhutan?

Bhutan, the Land of the Thunder Dragon, offers unique experiences throughout the year. The best time to visit depends on what you want to see and do.

### Spring (March - May): Best for Trekking & Flowers

Spring is one of the most popular times to visit Bhutan. The weather is warm and pleasant, with clear skies offering stunning views of the Himalayan peaks.

**Highlights:**
- Rhododendrons and wildflowers in full bloom
- Clear mountain views
- Ideal temperatures for trekking
- Paro Tsechu festival (usually in March/April)

**Average Temperature:** 15-20°C (59-68°F)

### Autumn (September - November): Best Overall Season

Autumn is considered the best time to visit Bhutan. The monsoon rains have cleared the air, offering crystal-clear views of the Himalayas.

**Highlights:**
- Best visibility for mountain views
- Pleasant hiking weather
- Thimphu Tsechu festival (September/October)
- Rice harvest season - golden terraced fields

**Average Temperature:** 10-15°C (50-59°F)

### Winter (December - February): Best for Budget Travelers

Winter offers fewer crowds and lower prices. While higher altitudes can be cold, valleys remain pleasant.

**Highlights:**
- Black-necked cranes in Phobjikha Valley
- Fewer tourists
- Lower tour costs
- Clear sunny days between cold spells

**Average Temperature:** 0-10°C (32-50°F)

### Monsoon (June - August): Off-Season

The monsoon brings rain, but also lush green landscapes. Some areas may be inaccessible due to landslides.

**What to Expect:**
- Heavy rainfall, especially in southern regions
- Lush, green landscapes
- Fewer tourists
- Some trekking routes closed

## Our Recommendation

For first-time visitors, we recommend **September to November** for the best overall experience. The weather is ideal, festivals are abundant, and the views are spectacular.

For budget-conscious travelers, **December to February** offers great value with fewer crowds.

## How Much Does a Bhutan Tour Cost?

Planning a trip to Bhutan requires understanding the unique pricing structure. Unlike other destinations, Bhutan has a minimum daily package rate that includes most expenses.

**Indian, Bangladeshi, and Maldivian nationals** are exempt from the SDF but pay a different fee structure.
